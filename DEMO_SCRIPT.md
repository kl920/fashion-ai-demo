## Demo Flow (10 minutes)

### Act 1: The Problem (2 min)

**Script:**
> "Let me show you a common problem in fashion e-commerce. Traditional fashion photography is expensive and time-consuming."

**Show slides or mention:**
- Average photoshoot: €5,000-50,000
- Time: 2-4 weeks from booking to final images
- Limitations: Can't iterate quickly, expensive to test markets
- Growing D2C brands struggle with professional imagery

**Transition:**
> "What if you could generate professional fashion photographs in under a minute, for a fraction of the cost? Let me show you."

### Act 2: The Solution (6 min)

**Open Fashion AI Studio**

**Step 1: Upload (1 min)**
> "Here's our interface. It's designed to be intuitive - anyone can use it, no technical skills needed."

- Click upload area
- Select your best sample image (t-shirt or dress)
- Show preview

> "We upload the garment image - could be from a flat lay, mannequin, or even a sketch."

**Step 2: Configure (1 min)**
> "Now we have full control over the output:"

Walk through options:
- **Model Type**: "Choose male, female, or diverse models"
- **Pose**: "Professional poses optimized for fashion"
- **Background**: "Studio, outdoor, urban - whatever fits your brand"
- **Style**: "From commercial to editorial photography styles"

> "These are the same controls professional photographers use, now automated."

**Step 3: Generate (2 min)**
> "Now watch this..."

- Click "Generate Fashion Image"
- While loading (30-60 seconds):

> "The AI is working right now, creating a photorealistic image. This usually takes 30-60 seconds. Compare that to booking a model, photographer, scheduling a shoot, post-production..."

**Show the result:**
- Wait for generation to complete
- Display the image

> "There we have it - a professional fashion photograph. The model, lighting, pose, everything is generated to commercial standards."

**Step 4: Iterate (1 min)**
> "The real power is in iteration. Let me show you..."

- Change background: "Studio to outdoor"
- Change pose: "Standing to casual"
- Generate again

> "In a traditional shoot, each variation would cost thousands and take days. Here, it's instant and costs pennies."

**Step 5: Download (30 sec)**
> "When you're happy with the result, download in high resolution and use it immediately in your store, marketing materials, or catalogs."

- Click download button
- Show saved image

### Act 3: The Opportunity (2 min)

**Key Points to Hit:**

**Market Size:**
> "The fashion photography market is worth billions. But more importantly, there are over 50,000 fashion brands globally struggling with high photography costs. Our target is the mid-market - brands with €1-50 million in revenue who can't afford constant professional shoots but need professional imagery."

**Business Model:**
> "We offer a SaaS subscription model:
> - Starter: €99/month - 100 images
> - Professional: €299/month - 500 images
> - Enterprise: Custom pricing
> 
> Our cost per image is roughly €0.10, giving us 90%+ gross margins."

**Competitive Advantage:**
> "While AI image generation exists, we're specialized for fashion. We understand garment accuracy, style consistency, and integrate with existing fashion workflows. We're not just an AI tool - we're a complete solution."

**Traction (if applicable):**
> "We've already [spoken with / signed up / are in talks with] X brands who are interested..."

**The Ask:**
> "We're seeking [€X investment / partners / customers] to [scale operations / expand features / enter new markets]. The window is now - before Adobe and Shopify fully integrate this. We have 2-3 years to capture the market and become the go-to solution or exit to a larger platform."

## Handling Questions

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "Can't big brands just build this themselves?"**
> "They could, but they won't. Large brands focus on their core business, not R&D for internal tools. Mid-market brands, which are 80% of our target market, definitely can't. By the time larger players consider it, we'll have years of fashion-specific data and integrations they can't quickly replicate. Plus, our exit strategy includes acquisition by platforms like Shopify or Adobe."

**Q: "How accurate is the garment representation?"**
> "Current AI is excellent for overall style and presentation, reaching about 85-90% accuracy for simple garments. Complex details like intricate patterns are improving rapidly. For most use cases - e-commerce, social media, concept testing - current quality is more than sufficient. And it improves monthly as AI models advance."

**Q: "What about model consistency?"**
> "Great question. For now, each generation is unique. We're working on consistent model faces across generations - a feature that will significantly increase value. This is on our roadmap for Q3."

**Q: "Isn't this replacing human models?"**
> "We see it as complementary. Brands still use human models for hero shots and brand campaigns. This is for the hundreds of SKU images, seasonal variations, market testing, and regional personalization that weren't economically viable before. We're enabling imagery that wouldn't exist otherwise."

**Q: "What about copyright and AI ethics?"**
> "Excellent and important question. Generated images are owned by the user. We use licensed AI models. For commercial use, we advise clients on proper usage rights. As for ethics, we build tools - how they're used is up to users within legal bounds, similar to Photoshop or any creative tool."

**Q: "Why won't Adobe/Shopify just add this?"**
> "They will eventually - that's exactly our exit strategy. We're building the specialized fashion solution they'll want to acquire rather than build. Think of how Shopify acquired dozens of specific e-commerce tools. Our window is 2-3 years to become the category leader, then exit to a platform."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
> "SaaS subscriptions to fashion brands. €99-299/month for small-medium brands, custom enterprise deals for larger clients. We also see opportunities in white-label licensing to agencies and e-commerce platforms."
